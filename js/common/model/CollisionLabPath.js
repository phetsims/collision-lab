/**
 * Model for the trailing 'Path' behind a moving object, including Balls and the Center of Mass. Originally called
 * 'Path' but changed to 'CollisionLabPath'. See https://github.com/phetsims/collision-lab/issues/79.
 *
 * Its main responsibility is to keep track of PathDataPoints that map out the trail of a Ball or the Center of Mass as
 * time progresses. In the design, the trailing 'Paths' only shows the recent path of the moving object AFTER the
 * visibility checkbox is checked, meaning the Path is always empty if the checkbox isn't checked and PathDataPoints
 * are only recorded if the checkbox is checked.
 *
 * CollisionLabPath will also remove PathDataPoints that are past the set time period, which allows the trailing 'Path'
 * to fade over time. See https://github.com/phetsims/collision-lab/issues/61.
 *
 * CollisionLabPaths are created for each Ball, which are never disposed, meaning CollisionLabPaths are also never
 * disposed and internal links are left as-is. This doesn't negatively impact performance since Balls that aren't in the
 * system aren't stepped and their positions don't change.
